  Birthday is a day 
  that occurs once in a year in everyone’s life. 
  This day commences with several warm wishes of
   ‘Happy birthday to you’ by our close ones after
    the clock strikes 12:00 in the night. Everybody 
    on their birthdays feels that this is their own 
    day and they are free to do anything. It is the 
    day when nobody scolds us. We get only love and 
    blessing on our birthdays. Our family, friends
     and relatives try to do something special for 
     us on this day that would please us from inside. 
     Children are most excited about their birthdays. 
     It is because they get several presents on this day
      and that makes them very happy. Everybody either 
      young or old celebrates their birthdays in their 
      own way or by inviting their friends and close ones
       to make the day a memorable one.If every father in the world had been like you, every child would have been a happy one. Happy birthday, dearest Daddy.
       My friends think you're cool, the neighbors think you're cool, your colleagues think you're cool, and most importantly, we think you are the coolest dad in the whole world. Happy birthday, Popsy.
       Happy birthday, Dad. We are so grateful for all of your love and support. Happy birthday!
       Dad, thanks for always being the backbone of our family and supporting us through good times and bad. We all love you. Happy birthday!
       All my friends know it is your birthday today because my Facebook says "Happy birthday to my most favorite person in the whole world." Can't wait to celebrate with you later today!
       What did we ever do to deserve a wonderful father like you? Let us return the favor with a day full of family fun, just the way you like it. Happy birthday, Dad.
       I am proud to have a father like you. Happy birthday, Daddy.
       We love you not because you are our dad, but because you are a caring father to your kids, loving husband to your wife, best mate to many, hard worker for your employers, and a terrific human being. Surprise! We all got together and planned a massive party. Happy birthday!
       I just want to say that I love you, old man. Happy birthday.
